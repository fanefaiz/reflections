How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it can help a alot more than imagined.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you have no headache of getting to know which files to go to.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros-
    	it'll be easy to bring people at one project
    	anyone can contribute
    cons-
    	bad choice can create a problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    this make it easy to track multiple files for a project easy, and git is for this purpose

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show all the changes
    and git using git diff id_1 id_next we can find changes in files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can do it without fear cuz we know we can get to back version if we want

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for projects i guess
